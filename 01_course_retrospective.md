## 1. What went well
- I was able to learn quite a few of the fundamentals of GitHub and React js in the previous semester because of Appdev1 and sir Elmer's teaching skills.
- I was able to expand my knowledge and discipline further because of the given activities, projects, and exams.
- I became aware of my classmates' skills and capabilities that allowed me to also assess of what skills and abilities I have and what I should work on. This allowed me to have a better glimpse of what I really wanted for my career and my future.
- I expanded my knowledge of the existence of different types of tools and softwares that I could use and utilize for different activities and scenarios.
- I am kind of proud of the accomplishments that I did with my activities and exams. I have not missed a single activity and exam and I am thankful for that.

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges
- A lot of things went wrong than went well, especially with the group project. I was really inexperienced with collaborating with fellow group members because I have little knowledge of the project that we did as well as the things that I have to do. Even though, I really did my best and research but I just lacked the ability to collaborate more and I lacked the knowledge of the things that I needed to accomplish.
- One of the few challenges that I had was with the relationships of data and the database schema as I have no idea of what our dev was doing as his knowledge and experience was incredibly much wider than mine. As well as the 15 diagrams that I did.
- In conclusion, I lacked the knowledge and collaboration skills that was needed.

## 3. Key Learnings
- One of the few key learnings that I had was on how I can improve the things that I lacked on the last semester, and I should work up on that this coming semester.
- One of the few key learnings that I also had was on what I really wanted for myself in the future regarding my career and the things that I really wanted to do. Although, I really liked my previous role of talking with clients or stakeholders, as I do think that I enjoy doing that, however, the paperworks was not what I expected. It was kind of heavy but it was fun to do, even though the paperworks that I did was kind of lacking. I am focusing now more on UI/UX, since I really loved designing and I do think that I am more suited with that role. However, since I just figured out my role, I am learning back from scratch.

## 4. Areas for Improvement

- I will focus more on graphics now, such as UI/UX as well as Photoshop and Animation.
- I also need to focus on my academics and I will strive for a consistent Dean's Lister in the upcoming semesters.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
- My expectation for the upcoming mobile development or AppDev2 is that the learning will be fun and interesting. As well as kind of slow, as I think I am a slow learner.
- I also expect to have my knowledge and skills improved.
- I also expect to have like the previous setup where there are lots of online activities and assignments that we can do.
